    <h1>Semantic Elements</h1>
    <h4>Summary of Semantic Elements and Examples</h4>
    <p>Just as the name implies, <strong><dfn id="def-semantic">semantic elements</dfn></strong> in HTML provides meaning, structure, and/or style to any line of text.
      Semantic tags were introduced in HTML5 so as to streamline communication for the browsers and the developers.
      Previously, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or the content division element was used to isolate and later provide structure and style through CSS.
      Turning common vocabulary into official markup elements avoided unnecessary coding with plenty of additional benefits.
      After introducing these elements, <strong> accessibility, searchability, internationalization, and interoperability </strong>were greatly improved
      therefore helping browsers, search engines, and developers able to communicate and understand web pages more efficiently.</p>
